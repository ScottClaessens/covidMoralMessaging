Over the last 100 years there has been NO side effects or complications from mega dose IV vitamin C. High dose IV vitamin C is know to kill many viruses including the flu. Also, they should let the public know about taking oral higher dose vitamin C and how to safely do that. The only side effect that I know of is GI Distress/(explosive) diarrhea if they take too much vitamin C or take their dose all at once instead of 1 or 2 grams throughout the day. Google high fose vitamin C to bowel tolerance (loose stool). You will fine that has been used for decades for many ailments. Signed an ICU RN of 20 years.

He cites his experience as an education department chair as having taught him about proper coronavirus response but doesn't say how his professional role provides him with relevant knowledge or expertise; it feels like deploying prestige in a pretentious, even blustering way, rather than in a persuasive way, although no doubt that was not the intent. Worse, he doesn't go into enough detail about how issues like how easily transmissible this virus is. Given the widespread misunderstandings associating this with the flu, it struck me as rather weak. It also was phrased in a frightening, intimidating manner: ""Think of the consequences,"" whereas a positive message might motivate people more, as in ""You can help save lives by staying home right now whenever possible."" On a separate point, this question seemed confusingly worded. ""How responsible do you feel about your own role in preventing further outbreak of COVID-19?"" On a third point, the question about political oppression was less difficult to answer for me than many of the surrounding questions because it asked about ensuring ""the overall well-being and happiness"" of people, not their survival (i.e. the stakes seemed low). On a fourth point, for contextualizing another answer, I work at home as a freelancer, so I didn't need authorization to do so. Finally, I'm not sure how much time I spend on social media. I put four hours a day, but it might be more or less on average (it is often more, I think, but I don't keep close track).
